## 🤷🏽‍♂️ About Me

I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California. My career interests lie in web development, check out some of my projects [here](projects) and on [github](https://github.com/pixelexel).

I love hiking, running, beaches and cricket. 2020 made me super interested in learning to live an examined life and practise meditation, [here](/books&more) are some of my favorite reads and resources.

## 🦕 What I've done before

Last summer, I interned at Amazon Web Services and built a web service for a platform used at major AWS conferences. The tech stack I used included React, Go and AWS services (API gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cloudformation and more)

During my undergrad, I attempted AI + medical research at BARC, Mumbai in analyzing uncertainty in medical vital sign measurements using fuzzy TOPSIS.

In 2018, my team won the innovation award at Smart India Hackathon for building a student analytics platform to identify underprivileged children in need of a scholarship. This [post](/mapping-external-data-to-django-model-attributes) outlines some of the challenges I faced while helping build the Django backend.
