## 🤷 About Me

I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California. My current interests lie in web development, check out some of my projects [here](projects)

I love hiking, running and watching the waves on an empty beach. 2020 made me super interested in learning to live an examined life and to that end, these are some of the resources I follow:

- [Waking Up by Sam Harris](https://app.wakingup.com/) (And his book by the same name)
- [Nathaniel Drew on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdWRLq10OHuy7HmSckV3Vg)

## 🦕 What I've done before

Last summer, I interned at Amazon Web Services, building a web service using React, Go and AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, Cloudformation, API gateway and more)

During high school, I organized [hackathons](http://mahacks.com/) & attempted bioinformatics research. I founded [Science and Us](http://scienceandus.org/) to introduce teens to the careers and anti-disciplinary mindset of science communication.

When I was 11, I loved Percy Jackson so much I ended up self-studying Modern Greek for 3 years, running a [linguistics Tumblr](http://subjunctivelymoody.tumblr.com/), and teaching myself Latin.
