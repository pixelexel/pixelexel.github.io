## 🤷 What I do

I'm majoring in Urban Planning with Computer Science & minoring in Comparative Media Studies. On campus, I dance, (try to) sing, & fry eggs at midnight with my friends.

This summer, I’m doing technical marketing at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) & a retreat at the [Recurse Center](recurse.com). At the [Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu/), I'm making a website to visualize air pollution data collected by sensors installed on garbage trucks and taxis.

## 🦕 What I've done before

Last summer, I interned at [Repl.it](https://repl.it/), an online code editor supporting 50+ programming languages & a community of 2 million makers.

During high school, I organized [hackathons](http://mahacks.com/) & attempted bioinformatics research. I founded [Science and Us](http://scienceandus.org/) to introduce teens to the careers and anti-disciplinary mindset of science communication.

When I was 11, I loved Percy Jackson so much I ended up self-studying Modern Greek for 3 years, running a [linguistics Tumblr](http://subjunctivelymoody.tumblr.com/), and teaching myself Latin.
